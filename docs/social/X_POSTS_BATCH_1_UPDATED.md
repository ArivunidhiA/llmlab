# First 6 X Posts - UPDATED (Humble Tone, Ready to Post)

## POST 1 - Intro
```
just joined X because I realized I've been learning way too much in private 😅

I'm Ariv — building AI stuff, trying to figure out how LLMs work, learning to ship fast. 
Main interest rn: making tools that feel good to use.

Let's figure this out in public 🚀
```

## POST 2 - Hot Take
```
honestly most "build in public" advice is boring.

everyone's posting "shipped today" with no context. where's the struggle? 
where's the "i spent 3 hours debugging and it was dumb"?

let's make this real.
```

## POST 3 - Problem Discovery
```
spent yesterday researching LLM APIs.

most devs i talk to have very less visibility into how much they're spending on Claude/GPT. 
they just... don't check 💀

feels like a problem worth solving.
```

## POST 4 - Learning Deep Dive
```
deep dive today on:
- why FastAPI > Flask for this
- PostgreSQL vs other options
- the proxy pattern approach

nerding out is the best part of building.
```

## POST 5 - Foundation
```
just spent 3 hours setting up:
- GitHub repo (public)
- Database schema
- API spec

nothing shipped yet but the foundation feels solid. scary part comes next 😅
```

## POST 6 - Idea Reveal (UPDATED)
```
working on something: LLMLab

problem: most devs building with Claude/GPT have very less visibility into their spend

solution: API proxy that logs everything. just swap your env var. that's it.

been talking to people. they say they'd use this.

thoughts? worth building? 🤔
```

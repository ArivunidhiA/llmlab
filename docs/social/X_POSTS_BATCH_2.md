# X Posts Batch 2 - Build Progress Posts

These posts come AFTER the initial 6 intro posts, once you've announced the idea (Post 6).
Timeline: Post 7-10 while building, Post 11-14 after launch.

---

## POST 7 - MVP Spec Done
**Timing**: Right after post 6 (reveal idea), maybe 24h later
**Context**: You've researched and defined exact scope

```
finished MVP spec after deep research:

- 4 endpoints (not 8)
- API proxy as hero feature
- zero code changes from users (just swap env var)
- 3 database tables
- github oauth auth
- scope is TIGHT

this is buildable in ~3 hours.

shipping this week 🚀
```

**Why**: Shows strategic thinking + confidence + action plan

---

## POST 8 - Backend Building
**Timing**: As soon as backend agent starts
**Context**: You're starting the actual build

```
backend build starts NOW.

FastAPI + Supabase + JWT auth.

the proxy endpoint is the make-or-break. if that works transparent + fast, 
the whole thing works.

nervous but let's ship 🤞
```

**Why**: Creates tension/drama, shows you're shipping

---

## POST 9 - Backend Done
**Timing**: When backend tests pass
**Context**: First major milestone hit

```
backend is LIVE locally. all 4 endpoints working:
- GitHub OAuth auth
- Store API keys (encrypted)
- OpenAI proxy endpoint  
- Stats endpoint

tested with mock & real calls. tests passing. shipping to Railway next.

frontend + CLI time 💪
```

**Why**: Proof of progress, momentum building, hype

---

## POST 10 - Frontend & CLI Building
**Timing**: When frontend/CLI agents start
**Context**: Moving to second/third phase

```
frontend dashboard coming together:
- cost breakdown bar chart
- daily spend table
- beautiful > feature-complete for MVP

CLI is 5 simple commands:
llmlab login
llmlab stats
llmlab proxy-key
...that's it

shipping this tomorrow 🔥
```

**Why**: Show parallel work, near-launch excitement

---

## POST 11 - All Complete, Ready to Deploy
**Timing**: When all 3 components are built + tested
**Context**: Pre-launch, everything ready to go live

```
OK something wild just happened.

all 3 components done:
- Backend ✅ (FastAPI, proxy working, tests passing)
- Frontend ✅ (Dashboard, real-time costs, beautiful)
- CLI ✅ (5 commands, pip installable)

full product built in ~5 hours. no bullshit.

deploying now. going live tomorrow.
```

**Why**: Wow factor, shipping speed credibility, builds hype for launch

---

## POST 12 - LAUNCH DAY
**Timing**: Day after all components ship
**Context**: Public launch

```
🔴 LLMLab is LIVE 🔴

you can now:
- pip install llmlab-cli
- log in with GitHub
- see your LLM costs instantly
- no code changes needed (just swap your env var)

spent ~6 hours building. 100% free. forever.

try it: [link]

would love your feedback 🙏
```

**Why**: Call to action, urgency, clear value prop, low barrier

---

## POST 13 - Launch Metrics (24h after launch)
**Timing**: Next day
**Context**: Early traction

```
LLMLab is 24h old:

- [X] signups
- [Y] GitHub stars
- [Z] CLI installs

honestly surprised by the speed. everyone i talked to said 
"oh wow i needed this but never knew it existed"

if you haven't tried it, link in bio 🔗
```

**Why**: Social proof, FOMO, shows momentum

---

## POST 14 - Retrospective (3-7 days after launch)
**Timing**: Week after launch
**Context**: Reflect on learnings

```
building LLMLab in 6 hours taught me:

1. scope down HARD (4 endpoints, not 20)
2. proxy pattern > decorators (users don't change code)
3. deploy first, perfect later
4. building in public = free marketing
5. the simplest solution wins

next: adding team accounts + email alerts

thanks for the support 🙏
```

**Why**: Thought leadership, shows learning, plans for v1.1

## Key Messaging Patterns

**Batches 1-2 Combined**:
- Posts 1-6: Establish vibe, show research, reveal idea
- Posts 7-11: Show shipping speed, momentum, completed work
- Posts 12-14: Launch, celebrate, reflect

**Total narrative arc**: Unknown builder → Finds problem → Ships fast → Launches → Reflects

**Total time: ~2 weeks** of content across the build

---

## Posting Schedule Recommended

**Option A: Spread out (authentic, lower saturation)**
- Post 1-2: Day 1-2 (intro)
- Post 3-4: Day 3-4 (research)
- Post 5-6: Day 5-6 (foundation + idea)
- Post 7: Day 7 (MVP spec)
- Post 8-11: Day 8-11 (building progress)
- Post 12: Day 12 (LAUNCH)
- Post 13-14: Day 13-15 (post-launch)

**Option B: Concentrated (maximum impact)**
- Post 1: Now
- Post 2-3: Tomorrow
- Post 4-5: Day after
- Post 6: Day after (reveal)
- Post 7-11: Over next 48h (building sprint)
- Post 12: LAUNCH
- Post 13-14: Follow-up

**Recommend Option A** (spread out = feels more authentic, less spammy)

## Notes

✅ All posts are authentic (not polished marketing)  
✅ Mix of technical + human  
✅ Show struggle + wins  
✅ Questions/engagement hooks  
✅ Call to action in launch posts  
✅ Credibility through transparency  

**Next step**: Backend completes → Post 8 ready  
**Then**: Frontend/CLI complete → Post 9-10 ready  
**Then**: All done → Post 11 ready  
**Then**: LAUNCH → Post 12  

Ready to ship on your signal! 🚀
